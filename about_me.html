		<p>I was borned in Los Angeles but moved to Georgia when I was 4 years old. I guess I can call myself a Southern girl now. <strong>NOT!</strong> I definitely never acquired the Southern accent! I love <em>traveling</em>, <em>cooking</em>, and of course <u>eating</u> so having family on the West Coast definitely gives me tons of opportunities to do both!

		<p>I graduated from Georgia State University with a <em>Bachelors in Biology</em>. After years of long and sleepless nights, I realized that the field wasn't for me. After <u>1 1 years</u> of being in a relationship, the now-husband finally proposed. This moment definitely <strong>changed</strong> my life. I had to really think about where my life was going. I hadn't found another career that I felt I had potential for. A random Facebook Ad changed everything! It was an ad for free coding tutorials for stay-at-home women/mothers.

		<h3>"THAT'S THE KIND OF LIFE I WANT! IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE?"
		</h3>

		<p>Those were the thoughts running through my mind. All these successful stories of others changing career later in life. It occurred to me that I can <em>potentially</em> start a new career and still have time for all the times I value! Remembering my <u>Xanga</u> days, I gotta admit I was pretty darn great at those pages. After plenty of researching and long nights reading every reviews, I decided to commit to it and register! <strong>Here I am now, embarking on yet another journey!</strong>
